# ReproducibleR

The goal of ReproducibleR is to help you to make your analysis reproducible.

## Prerequisites 

You need to have the following softwares:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to version your work
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to ensure that we work in the same container

### Install Git

- [Download page for all platform](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Install Docker

- [For windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [For Linux](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)


#### Check your install


```{bash}
docker run hello-world
```

#### Download an image and run it

Once you have docker, please run the following command. You will get a container
with R, RStudio and several useful packages (see more on
[Rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker)).

```{bash}
docker run -e PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASS> --rm -p 8787:8787 rocker/verse
```

Once you have downloaded it, you can open an Rstudio session in your web
browser. On Linux system, it will be at
[http://localhost:8787/](http://localhost:8787/). On other systems, `localhost`
will be replaced by your ip address. Your will find it when you launch the
Docker Quickstart Terminal. Please see [this
tutorial](http://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/02-Launching-Docker.html)
for more details.


## Use Docker


### Pointing a Docker session to your project 

```{bash}
docker run -e PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASS> --rm -p 8787:8787 -v /path_to_your_project/project_directory:/home/rstudio/project_directory rocker/verse
```


### Commit with git inside a docker container

While running R in a docker container, git will not know you since you are not
in your system environment.

If you run your Docker session which points to a git repository, you can
configure it locally. Your local git config will be available in the Docker
environment.    

In your project root, you can run:

```{bash}
git config user.name "FirstName LastName"
git config user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

```

You can check the local set up: `cat .git/config`
